# SAM (Smart Assistance and Management) Gamepad
Have a break for like 5 minutes and Halo won't launch fast enough for you to enjoy some FPSness? Then why not play something lighter and faster like say 2048 or the old classic mario? With Gamepad, you can control everything with your voice, just say up and mario jumps and further on. Or if you've time for FPS, then assign SAM the duty of throwing projectiles while your busy ripping skulls.
